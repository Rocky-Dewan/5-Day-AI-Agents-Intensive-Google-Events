Drug discovery is one of the areas where AI is having the most profound and rapid impact. Here are some of the latest developments and trends:\n\n**Key Areas of Advancement in AI-Powered Drug Discovery:**\n\n1.  **Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n    *   **De Novo Design:** This is a major leap. Instead of screening existing libraries, AI models can now *design* entirely new molecules with desired properties from scratch. This involves training models on vast datasets of known molecules and their characteristics, then prompting them to generate novel structures that are predicted to bind to specific targets, have good solubility, be less toxic, etc.\n    *   **Examples:** Companies like **Atomwise**, **Recursion Pharmaceuticals**, and **BenevolentAI** are heavily invested in generative AI for designing new drug candidates. **NVIDIA's BioNeMo** is also a significant platform enabling researchers to build and deploy generative models for drug discovery.\n\n2.  **Accelerated Target Identification:**\n    *   **Genomic and Proteomic Analysis:** AI can sift through massive datasets of genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data to identify novel disease targets (e.g., proteins or genes that play a crucial role in a disease) that might have been missed by traditional methods.\n    *   **Understanding Disease Pathways:** AI can map complex biological pathways, revealing intricate interactions that contribute to disease progression, thus pinpointing more effective intervention points.\n\n3.  **Predicting Drug Properties and Efficacy:**\n    *   **ADMET Prediction:** AI models are becoming increasingly accurate at predicting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of drug candidates early in the discovery process. This helps weed out compounds likely to fail later due to poor pharmacokinetic profiles or toxicity.\n    *   **Binding Affinity Prediction:** AI can predict how strongly a potential drug molecule will bind to its intended target, a crucial step in determining its potential effectiveness.\n\n4.  **Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n    *   **Finding New Uses:** AI can analyze existing drug databases and scientific literature to identify drugs already approved for one condition that might be effective against other diseases. This can significantly speed up the drug development timeline as safety and some manufacturing processes are already established.\n\n5.  **Optimizing Preclinical and Clinical Trials:**\n    *   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can identify biomarkers that predict patient response to a drug or indicate disease progression, leading to more targeted clinical trials.\n    *   **Trial Design and Patient Stratification:** AI helps in designing more efficient clinical trials by identifying the most suitable patient populations and predicting potential outcomes.\n\n6.  **AI in Small Molecule and Biologics Discovery:**\n    *   **Small Molecules:** Generative AI is particularly powerful for designing small molecule drugs.\n    *   **Biologics:** AI is also being applied to the design of antibodies, peptides, and other large molecule therapeutics, though this area is more complex.\n\n**Recent News and Trends:**\n\n*   **Increased Investment:** Venture capital funding in AI-driven drug discovery companies continues to be strong.\n*   **Partnerships:** Major pharmaceutical companies are forming strategic partnerships with AI drug discovery startups to leverage their technology.\n*   **FDA's Role:** The FDA is actively engaged in understanding and evaluating AI-generated data and drug candidates, signaling the growing maturity of the field.\n*   **Focus on Rare Diseases and Untreatable Conditions:** AI is offering new hope for tackling diseases where traditional drug discovery has struggled due to complexity or a lack of known targets.\n*   **Ethical and Reproducibility Discussions:** As AI models become more advanced, there's an ongoing discussion about the interpretability of AI predictions, the reproducibility of AI-generated results, and ensuring the quality of the data used for training.\n\n**In essence, AI is not just speeding up drug discovery; it's fundamentally changing *how* it's done, enabling scientists to explore a much wider chemical space and identify promising candidates with greater precision and efficiency than ever before.**\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the **second development** I mentioned in the context of drug discovery:\n\n**2. Accelerated Target Identification**\n\nThis area is crucial because before you can even think about designing a drug, you need to know *what* you're trying to target in the body to combat a disease. Traditionally, identifying reliable drug targets has been a painstaking, hypothesis-driven process. AI is revolutionizing this by allowing us to analyze immense biological datasets in ways that were previously impossible.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into how AI is accelerating target identification:\n\n*   **Leveraging Multi-Omics Data:**\n    *   **What is it?** \"Omics\" refers to fields of study that investigate biological molecules and their functions, such as genomics (genes), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), metabolomics (metabolites), and epigenomics (changes in gene expression that don't involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence).\n    *   **How AI helps:** AI algorithms can integrate and analyze data from multiple omics sources simultaneously. This provides a holistic view of the biological systems involved in a disease. For example, AI can identify genes that are overexpressed in cancer cells (genomics, transcriptomics) and then correlate this with specific protein abnormalities (proteomics) or metabolic changes (metabolomics) that are driving the cancer's growth. This cross-referencing helps pinpoint key players.\n\n*   **Uncovering Novel Pathways and Interactions:**\n    *   **Traditional limitations:** Human researchers are limited by their ability to process and connect the dots within complex biological networks. We tend to focus on known pathways.\n    *   **AI's advantage:** AI can identify previously unknown interactions between genes, proteins, and other molecules that contribute to disease. It can map these complex networks and highlight nodes (specific molecules) that, if modulated by a drug, could have a significant therapeutic effect. This is especially powerful for complex diseases with multiple contributing factors.\n\n*   **Analyzing Real-World Data (RWD) and Real-World Evidence (RWE):**\n    *   **What it is:** RWD comes from sources like electronic health records (EHRs), insurance claims, patient registries, and wearable devices. RWE is derived from the analysis of RWD to understand how a drug performs in a real-world setting.\n    *   **How AI helps:** AI can analyze vast amounts of RWD to identify patterns that might suggest new drug targets. For instance, observing a correlation between a specific genetic marker and a faster disease progression in a large patient population might point to a gene or protein involved in that progression as a potential target.\n\n*   **Identifying \"Druggable\" Targets:**\n    *   **The challenge:** Not all biological molecules that are implicated in a disease are easy to target with a drug. Some might be difficult to bind to with small molecules, or their modulation might have unintended side effects.\n    *   **AI's role:** AI can help predict the \"druggability\" of a potential target by analyzing its structure, function, and known interaction patterns, guiding researchers towards targets that are more likely to yield successful drug development.\n\n*   **Accelerating Hypothesis Generation:**\n    *   **From data to hypothesis:** Instead of researchers spending months or years forming hypotheses, AI can analyze data and generate multiple testable hypotheses about potential drug targets very quickly. Researchers can then prioritize and experimentally validate these AI-generated hypotheses.\n\n**Examples of AI in Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Companies like Atomwise and Recursion Pharmaceuticals** use AI to analyze vast cellular imaging datasets and identify cellular phenotypes associated with disease. They then use this to infer potential therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action.\n*   **Academic research groups** are employing machine learning to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data to understand cell-type-specific disease mechanisms and identify novel targets within those specific cell populations.\n\nIn summary, AI's ability to process, integrate, and find patterns in massive, complex biological datasets is a game-changer for target identification. It allows for a more systematic, data-driven approach, uncovering targets that might have remained hidden through traditional methods and significantly speeding up the initial, foundational steps of drug discovery.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies leading the charge in **AI-driven target identification**, which is a subset of the broader AI in drug discovery landscape.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
