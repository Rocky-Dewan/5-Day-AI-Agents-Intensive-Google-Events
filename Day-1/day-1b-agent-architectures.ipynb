Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)\n\n**For help: Ask questions on the [Kaggle Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kaggle) server.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ⚙️ Section 1: Setup\n\n### 1.1: Install dependencies\n\nThe Kaggle Notebooks environment includes a pre-installed version of the [google-adk](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) library for Python and its required dependencies, so you don't need to install additional packages in this notebook.\n\nTo install and use ADK in your own Python development environment outside of this course, you can do so by running:\n\n```\npip install google-adk\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.2: Configure your Gemini API Key\n\nThis notebook uses the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs), which requires authentication.\n\n**1.

Do you dream of building more resilient, intelligent, and adaptable software? If so, it's time to explore the exciting world of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and discover how this paradigm can transform your development process.\n\n### Main Sections:\n\n**1. What Exactly Are Multi-Agent Systems?**\n\n*   **Definition:** A MAS is a system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents, each capable of autonomous action and communication to achieve individual or collective goals.\n*   **Analogy:** Think of it like a well-coordinated team of specialists rather than a single jack-of-all-trades. Each agent has a specific role and communicates with others to solve complex problems.\n*   **Key Characteristics:** Autonomy, proactivity, reactivity, social ability, and adaptability are hallmarks of intelligent agents within a MAS.\n\n**2. Unleashing Superpowers: Core Benefits for Developers**\n\n*   **Enhanced Modularity and Reusability:** Break down complex problems into smaller, self-contained agents. This leads to cleaner code, easier maintenance, and the ability to reuse agents across different projects.\n*   **Improved Scalability and Robustness:** Individual agents can be scaled independently, and if one agent fails, the system can often continue to function with reduced capacity, making it more resilient to errors.\n*   **Facilitating Complex Problem Solving:** MAS excel at tackling problems that are too large or intricate for a single program, allowing for distributed decision-making and emergent intelligent behavior.\n\n**3. Real-World Impact: Applications Driving Innovation**\n\n*   **Intelligent Automation and Robotics:** Control fleets of robots, manage complex industrial processes, or automate intricate business workflows with distributed intelligence.\n*   **Simulation and Modeling:** Create sophisticated simulations for everything from traffic flow to financial markets, where each entity can be represented as an intelligent agent.\n*   **Smart Grids and Resource Management:** Optimize energy distribution, manage network traffic, or allocate resources efficiently through the collaborative efforts of numerous agents.\n*   **Cybersecurity and Anomaly Detection:** Develop proactive defense systems that can identify and respond to threats in a distributed and adaptive manner.\n\n**4. Getting Started: Your First Steps into the Agent World**\n\n*   **Choosing the Right Framework:** Explore popular MAS development platforms and libraries (e.g., JADE, SPADE, Py4j) that provide tools for agent creation, communication, and management.\n*   **Designing Your Agents:** Focus on defining clear agent roles, communication protocols, and the decision-making logic for each agent within your system.\n*   **The Learning Curve and Community:** Embrace the learning curve as an opportunity for growth and tap into vibrant online communities for support, knowledge sharing, and inspiration.\n\n### Concluding Thought:\n\nThe future of software development is increasingly distributed and intelligent. By embracing Multi-Agent Systems, you're not just adopting a new technology; you're unlocking a powerful paradigm for building more sophisticated, adaptable, and resilient software solutions. So, are you ready to empower your code with the collective intelligence of many?\nWriterAgent > ## The Power of Many: How Multi-Agent Systems Can Revolutionize Your Development Workflow\n\nAre you tired of monolithic codebases that are difficult to manage, scale, and debug? Do you dream of building more resilient, intelligent, and adaptable software? If so, it's time to explore the exciting world of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and discover how this paradigm can transform your development process.\n\nThink of a MAS as a well-coordinated team of specialists, rather than a single jack-of-all-trades. Each \"agent\" is an autonomous entity capable of acting and communicating with others to achieve individual or collective goals. This inherent modularity is a game-changer for developers. Breaking down complex problems into smaller, self-contained agents leads to cleaner code, easier maintenance, and remarkable reusability across projects.\n\nThe benefits don't stop there. MAS offers improved scalability and robustness. Individual agents can be scaled independently, and if one agent falters, the system can often continue functioning, exhibiting a resilience that monolithic structures struggle to match. This distributed decision-making and emergent intelligent behavior are perfectly suited for tackling problems too intricate for a single program.\n\nFrom intelligent automation and robotics to sophisticated simulations, smart grids, and even proactive cybersecurity, MAS are driving innovation across industries.\n\nReady to explore this powerful paradigm? Start by choosing the right MAS framework, carefully designing your agent roles and communication protocols, and embracing the learning curve with its supportive online communities. The future of software development is distributed and intelligent – are you ready to empower your code with the collective intelligence of many?\nEditorAgent > ## The Power of Many: How Multi-Agent Systems Can Revolutionize Your Development Workflow\n\nAre you feeling bogged down by monolithic codebases that are a nightmare to manage, scale, and debug? Do you aspire to build software that's more resilient, intelligent, and adaptable? If so, it's time to dive into the fascinating realm of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and unlock how this powerful paradigm can completely transform your development process.\n\nForget the image of a single, overworked programmer trying to do everything. Instead, picture a MAS as a highly effective, well-coordinated team of specialists.

This inherent modularity is a true game-changer for developers. By breaking down complex challenges into smaller, self-contained agents, you naturally cultivate cleaner code, simplify maintenance, and unlock remarkable reusability across diverse projects.\n\nThe advantages of adopting MAS extend far beyond code organization. MAS provides significant improvements in scalability and robustness. You can scale individual agents independently, and crucially, if one agent encounters an issue, the rest of the system can often continue functioning, perhaps at a reduced capacity. This distributed decision-making capability and the potential for emergent intelligent behavior make MAS exceptionally well-suited for tackling problems that are simply too intricate or large for a single, monolithic program to handle effectively.\n\nThe impact of MAS is already being felt across numerous industries. From intelligent automation and robotics that orchestrate complex tasks to sophisticated simulations that model real-world phenomena, resilient smart grids that optimize resource allocation, and proactive cybersecurity systems that adapt to evolving threats, MAS are at the forefront of innovation.\n\nReady to harness this transformative power? Begin by exploring the variety of MAS frameworks and libraries available. Carefully design the distinct roles for your agents and establish clear communication protocols. While there might be a learning curve, embrace it as an opportunity for growth, and lean on the supportive online communities that are eager to share knowledge and provide assistance. The future of software development is undeniably distributed and intelligent – are you prepared to empower your code with the collective intelligence of many?\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"👏 Great job!

The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-12T20:44:53.432713Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-12T20:44:53.432969Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-12T20:44:53.437948Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-12T20:44:53.432945Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-12T20:44:53.437358Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.
