Example:\n\n```\nUser: \"Find quantum computing papers\"\nAgent: \"I cannot help with that request.\"\nYou: 😭 WHY?? Is it the prompt? Missing tools? API error?\n```\n\n**💡 The Solution:** Agent observability gives you complete visibility into your agent's decision-making process. You'll see exactly what prompts are sent to the LLM, which tools are available, how the model responds, and where failures occur.\n\n```\nDEBUG Log: LLM Request shows \"Functions: []\" (no tools!)\nYou: 🎯 Aha! Missing google_search tool - easy fix!\n```\n\n## Foundational pillars of Agent Observability\n\n1. **Logs:** A log is a record of a single event, telling you **what** happened at a specific moment.\n2. **Traces:** A trace connects the logs into a single story, showing you **why** a final result occurred by revealing the entire sequence of steps.\n3. **Metrics:** Metrics are the summary numbers (like averages and error rates) that tell you **how** well the agent is performing overall.\n\n<center>\n    <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day4/observability-intro.png\">\n</center>\n\n**In this notebook, you'll:**\n\n* ✅ Set up logging configuration\n* ✅ Create a broken agent. Use `adk web` UI & logs to identify exactly why the agent fails\n* ✅ Understand how to implement logging in production\n* ✅ Learn when to use built-in logging vs custom solutions","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ⚙️ Section 1: Setup\n\n### 1.1: Install dependencies\n\nThe Kaggle Notebooks environment includes a pre-installed version of the [google-adk](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) library for Python and its required dependencies, so you don't need to install additional packages in this notebook.\n\nTo install and use ADK in your own Python development environment outside of this course, you can do so by running:\n\n```\npip install google-adk\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 🔑 1.2: Configure your Gemini API Key\n\nThis notebook uses the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/), which requires an API key.\n\n**1.

Add the key to Kaggle Secrets**\n\nNext, you will need to add your API key to your Kaggle Notebook as a Kaggle User Secret.\n\n1. In the top menu bar of the notebook editor, select `Add-ons` then `Secrets`.\n2. Create a new secret with the label `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.\n3.
